    <h1> Homepage </h1>
    <div>
        <h2> Anchors and it's uses.</h2>
        <p> In HTML we can use something called anchors, these are basically
            links that you can click and that will lead you to somewhere else.
            Anchors use the "a" tag. </p>
        
        <h3> Example:</h3>
        
        <a> click me :) </a>
        
        <p> If you clicked the anchor you will notice that it will lead you to nowhere,
            this is because within our code we didn't add end point or a site to lead you to.</p>
        
        <h3> Better example: </h3>
        <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/about"> click me :D </a>
    
        <p> In this last example we still used the anchor tag, only this time we added 
            an href attribute which we can use to add an end point and connect a link. 
            The format is as following "href = 'link'".</p>
